The age of an abalone can be estimated by cutting its shell, staining it, and counting the number of rings in the shell through a microscope. However, this process is time-consuming, boring, and can cause death to the creature. Therefore, it is necessary to find another non-collision method for age estimation. Other physical measurements, which are easier to collect, can be used to determine the age.  The subject of this notebook was to estimate the number of rings based on other independent features: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem. The task was completed successfully and we built our predictive models. With this dataset we are able to perform both regression and classification. We developed two supervised machine learning algorithms with scikit-learn library: polynomial regression and k-nearest neighbors. We also looked up for some techniques to tune up and improve their performance.
